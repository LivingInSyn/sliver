## Introduction

### What's a C2?

A command and control (C2) framework allows attackers to fully leverage existing access to computer systems or networks, it by itself will not get you access to systems that you do not already have. There are many techniques for gaining initial access, however some of the most common are exploiting software vulnerabilities using something like [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/), or by social engineering a user to inadvertently execute a C2 payload. This is referred to as "post-exploitation."
