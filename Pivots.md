⚠️ __IMPORTANT:__ Pivots in Sliver are used for specifically pivoting C2 traffic, not to be confused with port forwarding i.e. `portfwd` for tunneling generic TCP connections in/out of a target environment. 

⚠️ __IMPORTANT:__ Pivots can only be used in "session mode" (we may add beacon support later)
