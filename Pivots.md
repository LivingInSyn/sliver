⚠️ __IMPORTANT:__ Pivots in Sliver are used for specifically pivoting C2 traffic, not to be confused with port forwarding `portfwd`, which is used for tunneling generic tcp connections into a target environment. 

⚠️ __IMPORTANT:__ Pivots can only be used in "session mode" (we may add beacon support later)

Pivots allow you to create "chains" of implant connections, for example if you're trying to deploy a pivot into a highly restricted subnet that cannot route traffic directly to the internet you can instead create an implant that egresses all traffic via another implant in a less restricted subnet. Sliver v1.5 and later pivots can be arbitrarily nested, for example a pivot A can connect thru pivot B to a third egress implant.

Pivots perform an [authenticated peer-to-peer cryptographic key exchange](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Transport-Encryption#implant-to-implant-key-exchange-pivots) regardless of the underlying pivot protocol, therefore pivots can only communicate with other implants generated by the same server. This behavior cannot be disabled.

## TCP Pivots

TCP pivots are implemented in pure Go and are supported on all platforms. 

## Named Pipe Pivots (SMB)

Named pipe pivots are only supported on Windows.
