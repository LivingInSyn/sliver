## WireGuard SOCKS

In order to use `wg-socks` you'll need a WireGuard client, any client should work. However, we recommend using `wg-quick`, which is included in the `wireguard-tools` package available on most platforms (see [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for more platforms):

* MacOS `brew install wireguard-tools`
* Ubuntu/Kali `sudo apt install wireguard-tools`
