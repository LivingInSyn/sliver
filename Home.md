# What is sliver?

Sliver is a Command and Control (C2) system made for penetration testers. It generates implants (slivers) that can run on virtually every architecture out there, and securely manage these connections through a central server. Sliver supports multiple callback protocols including DNS, TCP, and HTTP to make egress simple. You can even have multiple operators simultaneously commanding your sliver army.
