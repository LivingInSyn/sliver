## What is sliver?

Sliver is a Command and Control (C2) system made for penetration testers, red teams, and blue teams. It generates implants that can run on virtually every architecture out there, and securely manage these connections through a central server. Sliver supports multiple callback protocols including DNS, Mutual TLS (mTLS), WireGuard, and HTTP(S) to make egress simple, even when those pesky blue teams block your domains. You can even have multiple operators (players) simultaneously commanding your sliver army.

## Sure, but what's a "Sliver"?!

Slivers are the best five-color creature tribe in [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en), of course! Each sliver is connected to a hive mind and takes on the abilities of every other sliver, exponentially increasing in strength as they gather.
