The easiest way to execute the unit tests is via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), which you will need to install.

Once you have Docker installed, just execute the `build.py` script. Keep in mind it will take extra time the first time your run the script since Docker will need to build the image from scratch. However, subsequent runs should be much faster since Docker will cache most of the layers.
